    <h1>Icelandic Geology</h1>
<div>  
  <p>This page gives links to all the pages that I have been working on, mostly related to the geology of Iceland. 
      These are just for fun, with some light research going in to a few of them. </p>

  <a href="/iceland_d208pb">Spatial distribution map of variation in &#916;Pb208 in Icelandic rock samples </a>
    <p> This map was complied in ArcGIS using spatial interpretation of data points collated together by the georoc database ad my own data. 
       The data is from basaltic samples only, since we wanted to measure the variation in Pb208 in the Icelandic mantle with as little crustal contamination as possible.
       The map shows exactly what one would expect — a lower &#916;Pb208 in the south west than in the north, and the highest values restricted to the areas around the proposed mantle plume and where the deepest melting is occuring beneath Öræfajökull.
